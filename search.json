    "text": "Denver Broncos fans haven’t had much to cheer for since the franchise’s Super Bowl 50 win in 2016. The franchise has experienced a revolving door at the league’s most important position since then. The “quarterback carousel” hasn’t been a fun ride for the Denver faithful. There have been a total of 13 starting quarterbacks (12 not including Kendall Hinton) over that time span.\nThe Broncos managed to win eight games in the 2023-24 season. Anyone who tuned in to the Broncos in 2023 would agree this season was much improved over their five wins in the 2022-23 season. Russell Wilson was a key catalyst in this improvement. His numbers were much improved. Given his significant statistical improvement, it begs the question: Is Russell Wilson really that bad?\nIs he the best Broncos quarterback since Peyton Manning?\nLet’s look at some numbers.\nPro Football Reference produces data for everyone who threw a pass in a given NFL season. This project utilizes only quarterbacks from the 2016-24 seasons. Within the Pro Football Reference data, there are many key passing stats. Some of the most notable include completion percentage, passer rate, touchdown passes, interceptions and season record. Looking at these stats allows for a good look at the top quarterbacks in the league.\nThe first question we’ll ask and answer is by touchdown to interception ratio, Who are the top quarterbacks in TD:INT ratio in 2023-24? This statistic is calculated by dividing season passing touchdowns by season interceptions.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\npassing2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2023.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2022.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2022, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2021.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2021, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2020.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2020, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2019.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2019, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2018.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2018, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2017.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2017, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2016 &lt;- read_csv(\"passing2016.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2016, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing &lt;- bind_rows(passing2023, passing2022, passing2021, passing2020, passing2019, passing2018, passing2017, passing2016) |&gt;\n  separate(QBrec, into=c(\"TotalWins\", \"TotalLosses\", \"TotalTies\"), sep= \"-\") |&gt; mutate(TotalWins = as.numeric(TotalWins))\n\npassinginfo &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  mutate(PlayerSeason = gsub(\"*\", \"\", PlayerSeason, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(PlayerSeason = gsub(\"+\", \"\", PlayerSeason, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\")\n\nselectqbs &lt;- c(\"Russell Wilson 2023\", \"Tua Tagovailoa 2023\", \"Jared Goff 2023\", \"Josh Allen 2023\", \"Brock Purdy  2023\", \"Patrick Mahomes 2023\", \"Jordan Love 2023\", \"Baker Mayfield 2023\", \"Trevor Lawrence 2023\", \"Matthew Stafford 2023\", \"Jalen Hurts 2023\", \"Geno Smith 2023\", \"Sam Howell 2023\", \"Bryce Young 2023\", \"Justin Fields 2023\", \"Derek Carr 2023\") \n \npassing2023tdint &lt;- passinginfo |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason %in% selectqbs) |&gt;\n  mutate(TdIntRatio = TD / Int)\n\ndenqbs &lt;- c(\"Russell Wilson 2023\", \"Jarrett Stidham 2023\", \"Russell Wilson 2022\", \"Brett Rypien 2022\", \"Teddy Bridgewater 2021\", \"Drew Lock 2021\", \"Brett Rypien 2021\", \"Drew Lock 2020\", \"Jeff Driskel 2020\", \"Brett Rypien 2020\", \"Joe Flacco 2019\", \"Drew Lock 2019\", \"Brandon Allen 2019\", \"Case Keenum 2018\", \"Trevor Siemian 2017\", \"Brock Osweiler 2017\", \"Paxton Lynch 2017\", \"Trevor Siemian 2016\", \"Paxton Lynch 2016\")\n\nbroncos &lt;- passinginfo |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason %in% denqbs)\n\ncmpltn &lt;- passinginfo |&gt; filter(Season == 2023)\n\nruss &lt;- passing2023tdint |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason == \"Russell Wilson 2023\")\n\nmahomes &lt;- passinginfo |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason == \"Patrick Mahomes 2023\")\n\nallen &lt;- passinginfo |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason == \"Josh Allen 2023\")\n\nqblabels &lt;- bind_rows(allen, mahomes, russ)\n \n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=passing2023tdint, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, TdIntRatio), weight=TdIntRatio)) +\n  geom_bar(data=russ, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, TdIntRatio), weight=TdIntRatio), fill=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"2023 Touchdown To Interception Ratio\",\n    title = \"Russell Wilson leading Patrick Mahomes?\",\n    subtitle = \"The Broncos quarterback leads many of the NFL's top quarterbacks in TD:INT ratio in 2023-24.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com | By Ben Ramsey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussell Wilson has the top TD:INT ratio against this bunch of the league’s upper echelon of quarterbacks. Although there are quarterbacks in the 2023-24 season that have a better ratio, Russell Wilson has a better ratio than three time Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes. Wilson was able to go out and post one of the league’s best TD:INT ratios in 2023-24, something that most people most certainly didn’t expect.\nWilson’s TD:INT ratio in 2023-24 is certainly impressive and largely unexpected, but how does he stack up against all 2023-24 quarterbacks in terms of completion percentage and rate?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=cmpltn, aes(x=Rate, y=`Cmp%`), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=mahomes, aes(x=Rate, y=`Cmp%`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=allen, aes(x=Rate, y=`Cmp%`), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=russ, aes(x=Rate, y=`Cmp%`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=qblabels, aes(x=Rate, y=`Cmp%`, label=PlayerSeason)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Passer Rating\",\n    y = \"Completion Percentage\",\n    title = \"Russell Wilson leading Mahomes and Allen?\",\n    subtitle = \"The 35-year-old's near 100 Rate puts him in range of the NFL's premier quarterbacks.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com | By Ben Ramsey\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, this scatterplot features every quarterback in the 2023-24 season who threw any number of passes. However, Russell Wilson is in a higher end of the quadrant than most would expect.\nWilson’s passer rate of 98.0 puts him ahead of top quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. When it comes to being better than the Broncos quarterbacks since 2016, this bubble chart with the size of the dot being scaled by number of wins shows that Wilson in 2023 is at the top compared to the other quarterbacks in their seasons.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=broncos,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int, size=TotalWins),\n    color=\"blue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=broncos, aes(x=TD, y=Int, label=PlayerSeason), size=3) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Touchdown passes\",\n    y = \"Interceptions\",\n    title = \"How have the Broncos quarterbacks performed since the 2016 season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Russell Wilson in 2023 is tied for most wins in a season, but has \\n the most passing touchdowns in a single season since Peyton Manning.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com | By Ben Ramsey\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face= \"bold\"),\n   axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n   panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n   plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussell Wilson in 2023-24 had arguably the best season by a Broncos quarterback since Peyton Manning without a doubt. Broncos fans will now have to once again go through a new ride with the team’s “quarterback carousel” with Wilson now being on the Steelers.\nWhere do the Broncos go next at quarterback? Only time will tell."

The high level of talent at the position has certainly resulted in some noteworthy seasons.\nIn 2013, Peyton Manning had a season that is viewed by many as one of the best seasons ever by a quarterback.
